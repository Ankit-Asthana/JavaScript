let number = 10

//datatypes 

/* Primitive */
//number -> range 2 to power 53
//bigint -> very large number
//string -> ""
//boolean -> true/false
//null -> stand alone value. When intentionally we assign null to a variable, ex (let name = null)
//undefined  -> when a data is not having any value in it , ex (let name)
//symbol -> unique

/* Non Primitive */
//object

console.log(typeof(number));  //this will give output as number
